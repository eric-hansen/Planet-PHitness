Planet PHitness
===

I'm a member of Planet Fitness and enjoy doing the non-cardio stuff there, which is also harder to track.  So, I'm creating
this webapp in PHP using the Symfony 3 framework to make this more possible.

There's no scientific backing of what results are displayed as of this writing.  This is more or less a fun little project
 I decided to partake on.
